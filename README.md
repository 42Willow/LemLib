# LemLib

Welcome to LemLib! This open-source PROS template created by Liam Teale from VRC team 1010N aims to introduce common algorithms like PID and Odometry for new and experienced teams alike.

The creation of this template was inspired by [EZ-Template](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template) and [OkapiLib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib). I wanted to create a library that is as easy to use as EZ-Template, but as feature-rich as OkapiLib.

Welcome to Lem\+Lib! This open-\/source PROS template created by Liam Teale from VRC team 1010N aims to introduce common algorithms like PID and Odometry for new and experienced teams alike.

Currently, Lem\+Lib officially support tank drive / differntial drive chassis only. Proper support for x-\/drive and mecanum drive has not yet been implemented, but some users have reported success with them.

The creation of this template was inspired by \href{https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template}{\texttt{ EZ-\/\+Template}} and \href{https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib}{\texttt{ Okapi\+Lib}}. I wanted to create a library that is as easy to use as EZ-\/\+Template, but as feature-\/rich as Okapi\+Lib.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
